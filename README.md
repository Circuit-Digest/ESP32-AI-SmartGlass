The ESP32 AI Smartglass is an innovative wearable device that blends the power of artificial intelligence with the convenience of home automation. Built around the ESP32-S3 mini microcontroller with 4MB of flash and 2MB of PSRAM, this smartglass is equipped to handle a variety of tasks efficiently. With built-in components like the INMP441 microphone, OV2640 camera, and MAX98357 I2S audio amplifier with a speaker, the smart glass is designed for seamless QR code-based control of household appliances. All the hardware is compactly integrated on a single PCB, which also forms the right leg of the smart glass, providing an elegant and functional solution. One of the standout features of the smart glass is its ease of use and versatility. By utilising the camera to scan QR codes, the user can control devices such as lights or fans connected to the same WiFi network. Once powered on, the RGB LEDs provide visual feedback during WiFi connection attempts, and the smart glass offers a welcome chime when the connection is successful. This smart glass removes the need for complex remote controls or hardwired switches, giving users a hands-free, efficient way to manage home automation with a simple glance at the desired QR code.
